This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to H2GIS, the new spatial extension
of the [H2][] database engine.

## What is H2GIS?

In a nutshell: H2GIS is to [H2][] as [PostGIS][] is to [PostgreSQL][].

H2GIS adds support for
* `(MULTI)POINT`, `(MULTI)LINESTRING` and `(MULTI)POLYGON` types
* the functions specified by the [OpenGIS][] [Simple Features Implementation
  Specification for SQL][] and
* additional spatial functions we develop.

If you get stuck or just have a question, send us a line on our [user][] or
